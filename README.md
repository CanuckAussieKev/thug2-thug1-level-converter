Converts THUG1's main, classic and skate shop levels, with their scripts, people and cars from your own copy of Tony Hawk's Underground (PC) to the formats of Tony Hawk's Underground 2 (PC), for its level
select. Nothing of either game is in this repository: the files are made from your copies each time. How it works,
what is converted and what isn't: [thug1_levels/README.md](thug1_levels/README.md).

- `thug1_levels/` - the converter (`thug1_levels.ts`: `convert`, `selfcheck`, `list` where it has one) and its tools.
- `thug1_campaign/` - the THUG1 campaign survey: what THUG1's story scripts call that THUG2 lacks (`script_gap.ts`, `thug1_sizes.ts`).

It depends only on [thug2-level-converter-core](https://github.com/CanuckAussieKev/thug2-level-converter-core) (pinned
to a commit in package.json): THUG2's formats and what the converters share.

## Usage

Needs Node 24 and NeverScript's `ns.exe` (QB scripts compiled): the
[THUG2 decompilation](https://github.com/CanuckAussieKev/thug2-decomp) builds it (`tools\build_neverscript.ps1` ->
`out\neverscript\ns.exe`, found there when this converter is used inside it) - or pass `--ns <ns.exe>`.

    git clone https://github.com/CanuckAussieKev/thug2-thug1-level-converter
    cd thug2-thug1-level-converter
    npm install
    node thug1_levels/thug1_levels.ts convert NJ --thug1 "C:\Games\THUG1" --thug2 C:\Games\THUG2 --ns <ns.exe>
    node thug1_levels/thug1_levels.ts selfcheck --thug2 C:\Games\THUG2

`convert` writes `<thug2>\thug2-decomp-thug1\` (not read by the game); without level names it converts the default
set (thug1_levels/README.md). The [THUG2 content pipeline](https://github.com/CanuckAussieKev/thug2-content-pipeline)'s
`menu_level/make_menu_level.ts` then installs every converted game's levels into the game's data overlay and level
select. In the decomp, where the pipeline installs this converter, the same commands are

    node tools/pipeline/run.ts thug1_levels/thug1_levels.ts convert --thug2 C:\Games\THUG2
    node tools/pipeline/menu_level/make_menu_level.ts --game C:\Games\THUG2

Checks: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` (the tests that need a game install skip without it).
