Converts THUG1's main, classic and skate shop levels, with their scripts, people and cars from your own copy of Tony Hawk's Underground (PC) to the formats of Tony Hawk's Underground 2 (PC), for its level
select. Nothing of either game is in this repository: the files are made from your copies each time. How it works,
what is converted and what isn't: [thug1_levels/README.md](thug1_levels/README.md).

- `thug1_levels/` - the converter (`thug1_levels.ts`: `convert`, `selfcheck`, `list`), its readers of THUG1's files, its people and the THUGPRO comparisons.
- `thug1_campaign/` - the THUG1 campaign survey: what THUG1's story scripts call that THUG2 lacks (`script_gap.ts`, `thug1_sizes.ts`).

## Dependencies

Each pinned to a tagged commit in package.json (`git+https://git@github.com/...#<commit>`; one copy of each: every repository that uses one pins the same commit):

- [thug2-level-converter-core](https://github.com/CanuckAussieKev/thug2-level-converter-core): THUG2's formats (scenes, collision, textures, archives, scripts), the level port's common steps. THUG1's own formats are read here.
- [thug2-thugpro-compat](https://github.com/CanuckAussieKev/thug2-thugpro-compat): the THUGPRO compatibility profile (`--compat`): the register's THUG1 data - spawns, THUGPRO's hand edits (applied with its `hand_edits.ts`; the content pipeline applies the same edit sections to THUG2's own levels), THUGPRO's own content by reference - and its port changes; `thug1_levels/thugpro_compare.ts --extract-thugpro` rewrites it (in a clone of that repository).

## Public API

What other repositories may import - package.json's `exports`, nothing else (`import ... from "thug2-thug1-level-converter/thug1_levels/driving.ts"`):

- `thug1_levels/driving.ts` - the THUG2 forms of THUG1's driving scripts (PC-THUG1-22): the content pipeline re-applies them to Anteara Mod's copy of car_scripts.qb.

Commands (package.json's `commands`: the tools with a command line - importing a module never runs one): `thug1_campaign/script_gap.ts`, `thug1_campaign/thug1_sizes.ts`, `thug1_levels/migrate_layouts.ts`, `thug1_levels/thug1_levels.ts`, `thug1_levels/thugpro_compare.ts`.

## Usage

Needs Node 24 and NeverScript's `ns` (the QB script compiler): `npx thug2-neverscript fetch` downloads it for your
system (Windows, Linux, macOS - from [our NeverScript fork](https://github.com/CanuckAussieKev/NeverScript)'s release,
SHA-256 checked) and the converter finds it there; or pass `--ns <ns>` / set `NEVERSCRIPT=<ns>`. Inside the
[THUG2 decompilation](https://github.com/CanuckAussieKev/thug2-decomp) its own build is used
(`tools\build_neverscript.ps1`). The converter needs only THUG2's data files, not its exe.

    git clone https://github.com/CanuckAussieKev/thug2-thug1-level-converter
    cd thug2-thug1-level-converter
    npm ci
    npx thug2-neverscript fetch
    node thug1_levels/thug1_levels.ts convert NJ --thug1 "C:\Games\THUG1" --thug2 C:\Games\THUG2
    node thug1_levels/thug1_levels.ts selfcheck --thug2 C:\Games\THUG2

`convert` writes `<thug2>\thug2-decomp-thug1\` (not read by the game) - or `--out <folder>`, which must be new, empty or an earlier output (any other folder is refused,
nothing in it touched); naming levels converts only those and keeps the others; without level names it converts the default
set (thug1_levels/README.md). The [THUG2 content pipeline](https://github.com/CanuckAussieKev/thug2-content-pipeline)'s
`menu_level/make_menu_level.ts` then installs every converted game's levels into the game's data overlay and level
select. In the decomp, where the pipeline installs this converter, the same commands are

    node tools/pipeline/run.ts thug1_levels/thug1_levels.ts convert --thug2 C:\Games\THUG2
    node tools/pipeline/menu_level/make_menu_level.ts --game C:\Games\THUG2

Checks: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` (the tests that need a game install skip without it;
`package.test.ts` checks package.json's exports, commands and pins). GitHub Actions runs them on every push
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Versions

Releases are tagged `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`; this is `v1.4.1` (core v5.2.1 / compat v1.0.7 (a partial convert keeps the other levels' people in peds.json); behaviour unchanged); `v1.4.0` (core v5.2.0: a kill only while a goal is on isn't a kill zone - Hawaii's gap-goal kill plane; Florida's water kills restart at TRG_Restart_Corner); `v1.3.1` (imports from core v5.0.0's numbers.ts / text.ts / json.ts / cli.ts (its py.ts split, names for what they do); behaviour unchanged); `v1.3.0` (paths written with / (path.join) instead of pyJoin and \-strings; core v4.0.0); `v1.2.1` (core v3.1.0: runs on Linux and macOS with the same output as on Windows; CI on all three); `v1.2.0` (ns found or fetched without the decomp, safe output folders, partial converts keep the other levels; core v3.0.0); `v1.1.0` (THUGPRO's profile from thug2-thugpro-compat; core v2.0.0). The repositories that use it pin the tagged commit.
